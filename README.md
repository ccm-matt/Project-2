This project is a Python web scraping and data visualization project focused on the Geometry Dash Fan Wiki on Fandom. Using requests, BeautifulSoup, and a Jupyter Notebook, I collected and analyzed data from pages from the Geomettry Dash Fan Wiki on Fandom.

Questions I'm Answering:
- What are the verification dates of some of Geometry Dash's most famous levels, and how do they compare to their current list placements?
- How do the attempt counts compare for the first 10 victors of one of my favorite extreme demons, Cold Sweat?
- What are the attempt counts for the verifiers of each level in the top 10, and is there a correlation between the difficulty of a level and the amount of attempts it takes?
- How many top 1 levels have there been in the history of Geometry Dash?
  
The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of Geometry Dash, a game I really enjoy, by exploring community data and visualizing interesting patterns.

  The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains all of the scraping code, data processing, and graphs created from the information I gathered.
