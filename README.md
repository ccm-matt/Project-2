This project is a Python web scraping and data visualization project focused on the Geometry Dash Fan Wiki on Fandom. Using requests, BeautifulSoup, and a Jupyter Notebook, I collected and analyzed data from pages from the Geomettry Dash Fan Wiki on Fandom.
The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of Geometry Dash, a game I really enjoy, by exploring community data and visualizing interesting patterns.

  The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains all of the scraping code, data processing, and graphs created from the information I gathered.
